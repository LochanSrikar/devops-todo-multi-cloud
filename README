# devops-todo-multi-cloud
Multi-cloud DevOps project with polyglot microservices for a Todo app.

Start: Project Setup (GitHub Repo Creation)
|
v
✅ Phase 1: Microservices Development (Polyglot Languages)
  - Todo (Python/Flask) → Handles CRUD, calls User & Notification
  - User (Java/Spring Boot) → Auth & profiles
  - Notification (.NET/ASP.NET) → Event-driven alerts
  |  
  Parallel: Commit & Push to GitHub (Version Control)
|
v
✅ Phase 2: Containerization (Docker)
  - Build Dockerfiles for each microservice
  - Test locally → Push to AWS ECR (Container Registry)
|
v
Phase 3: IaC Provisioning (Terraform)
  - AWS: EKS (Kubernetes Cluster) → ECR → S3 (Storage/Logs)
  - Azure: SQL DB (Data Storage) → Functions (Serverless Notifications) → Key Vault (Secrets)
  |  
  Parallel: Configure Cross-Cloud Networking (VPC Peering, Firewalls, Public Endpoints)
|
v
Phase 4: Security Integration (DevSecOps)
  - Scan images with Trivy
  - Manage secrets via Azure Key Vault → Inject into K8s
  - Apply Network Policies & RBAC in EKS
|
v
Phase 5: CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins + ArgoCD)
  - Jenkins: Build → Scan → Push images → Update K8s manifests in Git
  - ArgoCD: Sync Git manifests to EKS (GitOps deployment)
  |  
  Parallel: Deploy microservices to AWS EKS (Pods/Services/Ingress)
  |  
  Branch: Trigger Azure Functions from services (Serverless)
|
v
Phase 6: Monitoring & Logging
  - Install Prometheus/Grafana on EKS
  - Integrate Azure Monitor for cross-cloud metrics
  - Forward logs to AWS S3 or ELK stack
|
v
Phase 7: Testing & Optimization
  - Test APIs (Postman/curl) → Verify inter-service communication
  - Auto-scale in EKS → Cost opt with spot instances & serverless
  - Hybrid Test: Use Minikube locally before full deploy
|
v
End: Production-Ready App (Deployed on AWS, Integrated with Azure)
  - Cleanup: Terraform destroy if needed
